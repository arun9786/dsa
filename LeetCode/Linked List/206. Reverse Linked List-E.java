Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

Solution:-

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev=null,next=null;
        ListNode current=head;
        while(current!=null){
            next=current.next;
            current.next=prev;
            prev=current;
            current=next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We need to traverse the entire list once to reverse it.
Space Complexity: O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space to store the previous, current, and next pointers. The space required to store the final answer is not considered in this analysis.
