Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.
 

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count=0;
        Integer candidate=null;
        for(int num:nums){
            if(count==0){
                candidate=num;
            }
            count+= (num==candidate)?1:-1;
        }
        return candidate;
    }
}
