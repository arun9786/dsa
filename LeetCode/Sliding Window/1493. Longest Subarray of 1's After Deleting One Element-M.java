Hint
Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1 s in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1 s.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1 s is [1,1,1,1,1].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int left=0,zeroCount=0,max=0;
        for(int right=0;right<nums.length;right++){
            if(nums[right]==0){
                zeroCount++;
            }
            while(zeroCount>1){
                if(nums[left]==0){
                    zeroCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            max=Math.max(max,right-left);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of elements in the array.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using only constant extra space.
